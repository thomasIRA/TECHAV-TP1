Add the leeks and sauté for 4 minutes, until softened. Add the broth and bring to a simmer. Stir in the peas and asparagus and simmer, covered, for 3 minutes longer. Carefully place half of the soup in a high-powered blender and puree until smooth, then return it to the pot. Add the parsley and thyme (if using), and stir well to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve.","Image":"//20fix.com/xfood/img/green-pea-asparagus-and-parsley-soup.jpg"},{"id":"3804","Title":"Asparagus and Goat Cheese Frittata","Ingredients":{"1":"1 Tbsp olive oil","2":"1 Tbsp spring onion or green onion, white part only, finely chopped","3":"1/2 lb asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1/2-in/12-mm pieces","4":"4 large eggs","5":"1/3 cup heavy cream","6":"1 tsp salt","7":"1/4 tsp Tabasco sauce","8":"1/2 cup crumbled goat cheese"},"Instructions":"Set a medium rice cooker to the regular cycle or to quick cook if it's a fuzzy-logic machine. Heat the olive oil and sauté the spring onion for 1 minute. Add the asparagus and cook for another 3 minutes, or until the asparagus begins to soften. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, cream, salt, and Tabasco. Pour the egg mixture over the asparagus and sprinkle with the goat cheese.\nCover the rice cooker and reset to the regular cycle. The frittata will take 3 to 4 minutes to cook. Allow it to continue steaming, covered, for an additional 6 minutes on the keep-warm setting or with the machine turned off. (Many rice cookers, including all fuzzy-logic machines, do this automatically.) Serve warm or at room temperature.","Image":"//20fix.com/xfood/img/asparagus-and-goat-cheese-frittata-56389575.jpg"},{"id":"3809","Title":"Griddled Asparagus, Piperade, Poached Eggs, and Grits","Ingredients":{"1":"2 cups chicken stock","2":"2 tablespoons unsalted butter","3":"Sea salt","4":"1/2 cup white corn grits","5":"1/2 cup heavy cream","6":"3 tablespoons olive oil","7":"4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced","8":"1/2 cup thinly sliced shallots","9":"1 cup julienned red bell pepper","10":"2 roma tomatoes, peeled and coarsely chopped","11":"2 bay leaves","12":"1 teaspoon ground Espelette pepper","13":"1 tablespoon sherry vinegar","14":"1/2 pound asparagus, tough ends removed, spears peeled if thick","15":"4 Perfectly Poached Eggs"},"Instructions":"In a medium saucepan, combine the chicken stock, butter, and sea salt to taste, and bring to a boil over high heat. Whisk in the grits and stir for 1 minute with a wooden spoon. Reduce the heat to low and cook the grits, stirring often, for 20 minutes or until they are tender. Finish the grits with the cream, add more sea salt to taste, and stir well. Cover to keep warm. (I use the waxed paper from a stick of butter for this, placed butter side down over the grits so they don't develop an unseemly crust.)\nMeanwhile, in a medium saucepan combine 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and the garlic. Slowly cook the garlic over medium-low heat, making sure not to allow any color to develop, for about 5 minutes. Add the shallots, bell peppers, and a few pinches of sea salt. Cook for 12 minutes or until tender. Add the tomatoes, bay leaves, and Espelette pepper. Continue to cook for 15 more minutes or until the consistency is much like a thick soup. Finish with the sherry vinegar and sea salt to taste, and cover and set aside to keep warm. Remove the bay leaves prior to serving.\nPlace a large cast-iron sauté pan over medium-high heat. In a mixing bowl, toss the asparagus, the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, and a few pinches of sea salt. When the pan is giving off a light smoke, place the asparagus in the hot pan and cook for 2 minutes. Turn the asparagus over and cook for an additional 2 minutes. The asparagus should have good, even char marks all around and be crisp-tender. Remove from the heat.\nSpoon the grits evenly onto 4 plates. Place a poached egg on each plate, and arrange the griddled asparagus and pipérade over the top.","Image":"//20fix.com/xfood/img/griddled-asparagus-piperade-poached-eggs-and-grits-56389574.jpg"},{"id":"3832","Title":"Roast Chicken with Rhubarb Butter and Asparagus","Ingredients":{"1":"1 large rhubarb stalk, cut into 1/2\" pieces","2":"1/4 cup fresh orange juice","3":"2 tablespoons honey","4":"1 tablespoon finely grated peeled ginger","5":"1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature","6":"Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper","7":"1 (3 1/2–4-pounds) chicken, backbone removed, chicken patted dry","8":"2 tablespoons olive oil, divided","9":"1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves","10":"1 bunch asparagus, trimmed","11":"2 lemons, halved"},"Instructions":"Bring rhubarb, orange juice, honey, and ginger to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until rhubarb is soft but not falling apart, about 5 minutes. Drain over a small bowl. Reserve cooking liquid and rhubarb separately; let cool.\nMix rhubarb and butter in a small bowl until smooth; season with salt and pepper. Set aside 1 tablespoon rhubarb butter for vegetables.\nPreheat oven to 400°F. Place chicken, skin side up, on a rimmed baking sheet. Gently slide your fingers underneath skin to loosen and rub flesh all over with remaining rhubarb butter (try not to tear skin). Drizzle chicken with 1 tablespoon oil and some of the reserved rhubarb cooking liquid, scatter thyme over, and season with salt and pepper.\nRoast chicken until skin is browned and crisp and meat is cooked through (juices will run clear and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh should register 165°F), 40–50 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, prepare grill for mediumhigh heat (or heat a grill pan over medium-high). Toss asparagus in a large bowl with remaining 1 tablespoon oil; season with salt and pepper. Grill asparagus and lemons (cut side down), turning asparagus often, until stalks are just tender, 2–3 minutes. Let lemon halves cool.\nToss asparagus with reserved rhubarb butter. Serve chicken and asparagus with any pan juices drizzled over with grilled lemons for squeezing over.","Image":"//20fix.com/xfood/img/roast-chicken-with-rhubarb-butter-and-asparagus-56389535.jpg"},{"id":"3861","Title":"Tagliatelle with Asparagus and Parmesan Fonduta","Ingredients":{"1":"2 large egg yolks","2":"1 1/2 cups crème fraîche","3":"5 ounces Parmesan cheese, finely grated, plus a bit more for finishing","4":"1 medium garlic clove, finely grated on a rasp-style grater","5":"Kosher salt","6":"1 pound asparagus, woody bottoms snapped off, stalks cut on the diagonal into long 1/2- inch-thick pieces, tips left whole","7":"1/2 recipe Fresh Egg Pasta , cut into tagliatelle"},"Instructions":"Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, bring an inch or two of water to a boil in a small pot. Whisk together the egg yolks, crème fraîche, Parmesan, and garlic in a large heatproof bowl that will fit snugly in the pot without making contact with the boiling water.\nSet the bowl in the small pot and whisk the egg mixture constantly, occasionally scraping the sides and removing the bowl from the pot every couple of minutes as you whisk to keep the cooking nice and slow (don't let it bubble). The mixture will look thick and clumpy for a few seconds, then become liquidy, and then, once the cheese has melted, silky smooth. Cook just until the liquidy sauce has thickened slightly (it should thinly coat the back of a spoon), 6 to 8 minutes. Set the bowl aside in a warm place.\nSalt the large pot of boiling water generously until it tastes slightly less salty than the sea. If you're confident that the pasta and asparagus will finish cooking at the same time, add them both to the water. If you're a worrywart, cook the asparagus first, scoop it into a colander to drain, then cook the pasta. Cook the asparagus until it is juicy with a slight bite, 3 to 4 minutes; and cook the pasta until it is fully cooked, 3 to 4 minutes.\nDrain the pasta and asparagus well in a colander, then pop them back into the now-empty pot. Pour in most of the fonduta and toss gently but well. Season to taste with salt and more fonduta, if you'd like. Transfer to bowls, top with a little more Parmesan, and eat straightaway.","Image":"//20fix.com/xfood/img/tagliatelle-with-asparagus-and-parmesan-fonduta-56389514.jpg"}],"t":114,"p":{"limitstart":0,"limit":25,"total":114,"pagesStart":1,"pagesStop":5,"pagesCurrent":1,"pagesTotal":5}}}
